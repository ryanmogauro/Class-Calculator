Info on GPA calculator
</h1>
<p> Our GPA calculator solely calculates an unweighted GPA (out of 4.0), though a weighted GPA calculator is in the works. Keep in mind that your school may use a different scale to calculate your GPA, so while the GPA this calculator returns will be accurate for the standard unweighted model, your school may assign you a different figure. I am always looking to improve our site, so if you have any questions, inquiries, or suggestions, please reach out to rmogauro@gmail.com. Thanks!

  If you are interested, here is the equation used to calculate a student's GPA:
<br>
  ((# of A+s x 4) + (# of As x 4) + (# of A-s x 3.7) + (#  of B+s x 3.3) + (#  of Bs x 3) + (# of B-s x 2.7) + (# of C+s x 2.3) + (# of Cs x 2) + (# of C-s x 1.7) + (# of D+s x 1.3) + (# of Ds x 1) + (# of D-s x .7)) รท ((# of A+s) + (# of As) + (# of A-s) + (# of B+s) + (# of Bs) + (# of B-s) + (# of C+s) + (# of Cs) + (# of C-s) + (# of D+s) + (# of Ds) + (# of D-s))
