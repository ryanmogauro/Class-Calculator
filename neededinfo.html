<h1>Needed grade calculator info</h1>
<p>
The needed grade calculator is designed to tell a student the grade they need on their final/midterm in order to achieve a certain overall grade in the course. To determine a student's needed grade, we use their current grade in the class, their desired overall grade in the class, and the weight of their final/midterm. In my opinion, this is the most useful product we offer. If you have any questions, inquiries, or suggestions, please reach out to rmogauro@gmail.com.

If you are interested, here is the equation we use to calculate a student's needed grade:
<br>
(desired grade - (current grade*(1-(weight of final*))) / weight of final
<br>
* = as a decimal
