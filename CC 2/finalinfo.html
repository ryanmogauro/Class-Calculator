<h1>Final Grade Calculator Info</h1>
<p>The final grade calculator is intended to calculate a student's overall grade in their class, using their grade in the class before the final, their grade on the final, and the weight of the final. It is most practical for students who have already taken their final. If you haven't taken your final/midterm, but are wondering how it will affect your grade, the <a href = "needed.html"> needed grade calculator</a> is likely more appropriate for you. If you have any questions, inquiries, or suggestions, please reach out to rmogauro@gmail.com.

If you are interested, here is the equation we use to calculate a student's overall grade:
<br>
((1-weight of final*) x grade in class) + (weight of final* x grade on final)
<br>
* = as a decimal
